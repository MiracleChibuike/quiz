It is made with HTML 5, CSS3, Bootstrap v5 and JavaScript. You can message me directly for the source code.

In the homepage, after reading the instructions, click on the start quiz button which will prompt you a message to enter your name:: "Please ensure you enter it". 
It will take you to the first question where you're going to see multiple options to select from, when you select the wrong answer, the page will alert you how many score's you have gotten which is 0, and then tells you the correct answer in the paragraph which is hidden by default. 
Each right answer you got, gives you a total point of 2. 
The other pages eg questions 2 - 20 has previous buttons on them which directs the user back to the previous question answered.
